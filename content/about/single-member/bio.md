Hi,

I'm the author and developer of the Greenflare SEO Web Crawler. In the past few years, I have helped a wide variety of E-Commerce businesses grow their organic traffic and revenue through SEO. As a technical minded person, I love to explore and test new technologies. The SEO community has always been welcoming and offering countless free tools and resources. With Greenflare, I'm proud to give back (a little) to the amazing community.
